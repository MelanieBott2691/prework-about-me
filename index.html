      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I don't have a lot of time for hobbies. I mainly try to keep up with my 3 kids, work and continue learning. I do love volunteering in my kids schools and within the community.</p>

      <p>Helping businesses grow.</p>

      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I run a veterinary clinic in Springville, Utah and through juggling the business side I have found that I enjoy marketing. I recently graduated from Washington State University with my master’s in strategic communication and want to add to this education and learn to program. I’ve told my kids for years that they need to learn to code so I am taking the step to inspire them to do so. </p>
